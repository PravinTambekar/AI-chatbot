# PDF to Podcast Converter
- This project is a Streamlit-based web application that converts PDFs into speech, enabling users to listen to document content as audio. It leverages LangChain, Hugging Face models, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ensure high-quality text-to-speech conversion. The app processes PDFs, extracts text, generates speech, and allows users to play or download the audio. Ideal for researchers, students, and professionals who prefer listening over reading.
